# Book-to-Lightbulb Transformation

S = Looping GIF: Open book → lightbulb bursts out with glowing particles.

P = You’re designing a celebration moment for a learning app.

A = Blue background, glowing yellow bulb, smooth motion, soft explosion.

R = Book = knowledge, bulb = insight. Explosion = “aha!” moment.

K = Try versions with stronger glow, bigger burst, or softer motion.


SPARK Framework PROMPT:

S – Specify the task:
Create a short looping GIF where an open book sits on a surface, and a glowing yellow lightbulb bursts upward from its center, with light particles and pages flying out in a soft explosion. Use a vertical format (300x400 or 512x512) with smooth animation.

P – Provide perspective:
You are a motion designer creating a celebratory animation for a learning app. The animation is shown when a user completes reading a summary—symbolizing knowledge turning into insight.

A – Add examples:
Use a cinematic, soft-glow style like the attached example. Background: gradient blue. Foreground: realistic book and glowing bulb with light bursts. Animation style: smooth, elegant explosion of particles and subtle movement.

R – Reasoning required:
The open book symbolizes accumulated knowledge; the lightbulb and particles represent the transformation into an “aha” insight. The explosion effect adds emotional reward and energy to the user experience.

K – Keep improving:
Generate variations with different explosion intensities, bulb glow strengths, and background colors to test which one feels most rewarding and aligned with the brand tone.
